            <h2>1. APPLICATION SUBMISSION</h2>
            <p>Applicants can apply for adoptions online or in person. The review takes a few days, and approval status is communicated via email or phone. Upon approval, a timeframe of 24 to 48 hours is given to complete the adoption. If an applicant applies for a pet with a pending application, they're advised to follow up after a few days, as adoptions may fall through, offering other applicants a chance.</p>        </section>

            <h2>3. MEETING THE DOG</h2>
            <p>When meeting a dog, approach calmly without direct eye contact, as it may seem aggressive. Ask the guardian for permission before interacting. Let the dog initiate contact and approach you at their pace. Be patient, allowing them to sniff you. Watch their body language for comfort cues. Respect their space and avoid sudden movements or noise. Give them time to adjust and refrain from overwhelming them with affection if they're not ready.</p>

            <h2>4. FINAL VET CHECK</h2>
<p>The final vet check confirms the pet's health status before adoption. It includes a thorough examination by a veterinarian to detect any illnesses or underlying conditions. This check ensures the pet is physically healthy, up-to-date on vaccinations, and has received proper medical care. It assures adopters of the pet's health and well-being in its new home.</p>
